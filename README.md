# UserAuthenticationFlow-Combine
User Authentication Flow - A challenge to showcase Combine skills

To gain experience using Combine, I asked ChatGPT to generate challenges to complete. This repo is my solution.

## The Challenge

- Present a login screen with username and password fields.
- Validate the username and password inputs.
- Upon successful validation, make a network request to authenticate the user.
- Display loading indicators during the authentication process.
- Handle and display appropriate error messages if authentication fails.
- If authentication is successful, transition to a home screen or display a success message.
